# Developing a Machine-Learning Algorithm to Predict Fractional Free Volume from a Polymer Structure

**Overview**

This project develops a machine-learning tool to predict fractional free volume (FFV) from a given polymer structure. FFV is difficult to experimentally measure; thus, being able to predict this polymer property can be useful when designing new polymer systems, such as for drug delivery.
